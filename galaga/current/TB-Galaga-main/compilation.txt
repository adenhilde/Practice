Galaga!

This is the classic arcade game Galaga but now in your console. You use the
arrow keys to move your player '^' and press space to fire a bullet. Try to hit
as many bugs as possible and avoid their drop attacks and their bullets.
Nice and simple, right? Harder than it looks. Aim for that high score and have
fun!
