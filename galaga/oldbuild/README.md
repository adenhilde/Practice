# TB-Galaga

As of currently, the game runs for 2 or 3 rounds before a memory error, most likely a bug being deleted and then a reference being made to that bug when it responds, which is crashing the game. Currently trying to find the memory issue. Otherwise, it works pretty good. We can use some menus and stuff.
